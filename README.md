Question 1:
You can control the Snapping Sheet using the SnappingSheetController
The features that allows the developer to control are: 
a.SnappingPositions: It determines the snapping positions where the sheet can snap to.
To change the snap positions for the sheet, change the snappingPositions parameter.
b.There is a method called snapToPosition: using this method we can change the position of the snap sheet

Question 2:
The parameter that allows the bottom sheet to snap into position with various different
animations is snappingPositions Property as explained above it determines the
snapping positions where the sheet can snap to of the SheetBelow.

Question 3: 
An advantage of InkWell we can point at is that InkWell has a ripple effect tap and features that are related 
to ink meanwhile GestureDetector has none of the mentioned above.
On the other hand using GestureDetector we can detect every kind of interaction the user has with the screen.
